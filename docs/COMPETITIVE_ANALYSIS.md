### Key Differentiators (What Only Converso Has)
1. **Vertical focus on service businesses** — no competitor does this as SaaS
2. **Deep bilingual EN/ES** — optimized for the US service business market where EN/ES bilingual support is a daily need, not a checkbox feature
3. **Visual playbook builder** tied to industry-specific workflows (not generic chatbot flows)
4. **Integrated lead-to-handoff pipeline** — lead capture → qualification → live handoff → CRM, purpose-built for service businesses
5. **Knowledge base + playbooks** working together — RAG answers + guided conversation flows

### Competitive Risks
1. **Tidio going vertical** — they have the resources and features to launch industry-specific templates
2. **Chatbase's momentum** — $8M ARR bootstrapped proves the market. If they add a flow builder, the gap narrows
3. **Pricing pressure** — multiple competitors offer free tiers and aggressive entry pricing
4. **Enterprise players** (Intercom, Zendesk, Freshchat) adding AI chatbot features to existing platforms

### Opportunities
1. **"Chatbase for service businesses"** — proven market, vertical wedge
2. **Bilingual EN/ES is underserved** — no one optimizes for the ~60M Spanish speakers in the US
3. **Playbook templates marketplace** — industry-specific templates (HVAC, legal, dental, auto repair) create lock-in
4. **Agency/reseller channel** — marketing agencies serving service businesses can white-label Converso
