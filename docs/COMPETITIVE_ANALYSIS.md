- Service-business-specific playbooks vs generic flows
- Bilingual EN/ES depth vs broad-but-shallow 47-language support
- Lower price point at entry level

```

### Key Differentiators (What Only Converso Has)
1. **Vertical focus on service businesses** — no competitor does this as SaaS
2. **Deep bilingual EN/ES** — optimized for the US service business market where EN/ES bilingual support is a daily need, not a checkbox feature
3. **Visual playbook builder** tied to industry-specific workflows (not generic chatbot flows)
4. **Integrated lead-to-handoff pipeline** — lead capture → qualification → live handoff → CRM, purpose-built for service businesses
5. **Knowledge base + playbooks** working together — RAG answers + guided conversation flows

### Competitive Risks
1. **Tidio going vertical** — they have the resources and features to launch industry-specific templates
2. **Chatbase's momentum** — $8M ARR bootstrapped proves the market. If they add a flow builder, the gap narrows
3. **Pricing pressure** — multiple competitors offer free tiers and aggressive entry pricing
4. **Enterprise players** (Intercom, Zendesk, Freshchat) adding AI chatbot features to existing platforms

### Opportunities
1. **"Chatbase for service businesses"** — proven market, vertical wedge
2. **Bilingual EN/ES is underserved** — no one optimizes for the ~60M Spanish speakers in the US
3. **Playbook templates marketplace** — industry-specific templates (HVAC, legal, dental, auto repair) create lock-in
4. **Agency/reseller channel** — marketing agencies serving service businesses can white-label Converso

## Phase 1 Launch Gap Analysis

Cross-referencing competitor table stakes against what Converso has built today. Grouped by launch priority.

### What's DONE and Competitive (ship as-is)

| Feature | Status | Competitive Position |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| Auth + multi-tenancy + RBAC | Done | On par with all competitors |
| Chat UI with streaming | Done | On par (streaming is table stakes) |
| Knowledge base / RAG (website, PDF, text, URL) | Done | On par with Chatbase, Tidio, ChatBot |
| Lead capture + scoring + activity logging | Done | Stronger than Denser, BigSur; on par with Chatbase |
| Visual playbook builder (7 step types) | Done | **Advantage** — Chatbase and Denser don't have this |
| Stripe billing (plans, subscriptions, portal) | Done | On par |
| Admin dashboard (10 tabs) | Done | On par with Tidio; more comprehensive than Chatbase |
| Embeddable widget with conversation tracking | Done | On par |
| Bilingual EN/ES (detection + translations + UI) | Done | **Advantage** — no competitor specializes in EN/ES |
| Human handoff (queue, agent assignment, AI summary) | Done | On par with Tidio, Chatbase |
| Brand voice (custom system instructions) | Done | On par |

### CRITICAL Gaps — Must fix before launch

These are things every competitor ships and customers will expect on day one.

#### 1. Onboarding Wizard
- **Gap:** Converso auto-provisions (user → business → bot → subscription) but drops users at the dashboard with no guidance.
- **Competitors:** Chatbase has "paste your URL → chatbot in 2 minutes." Tidio has a guided setup flow. ChatBot has same-day setup promise.
- **Why critical:** Activation is everything for self-serve SaaS. If users don't ingest knowledge + install the widget in their first session, they churn.
- **Recommendation:** Build a 4-step onboarding checklist that persists until complete:
  1. Name your business + bot
  2. Add knowledge (paste URL or upload PDF)
  3. Test your chatbot
  4. Copy embed code to your website
- **Effort:** Medium (UI + state tracking, no new backend)

#### 2. Plan Limit Enforcement
- **Gap:** Code has `TODO` comments — three endpoints default to `entitlementsByPlan.free` without enforcing actual plan limits. Playbooks, retraining, and other features don't gate on plan.
- **Competitors:** Every paid competitor enforces limits. Chatbase limits credits. Tidio limits conversations.
- **Why critical:** Without enforcement, free users have no reason to upgrade. Billing is theater.
- **Recommendation:** Wire up plan limit checks across all gated endpoints. Show usage vs limit in admin.
- **Effort:** Medium (logic exists in schema, needs enforcement layer)

#### 3. Hot Lead / Handoff Notifications
- **Gap:** When a lead is qualified as "hot" or requests human handoff, nothing notifies staff. They'd have to be staring at the admin panel.
- **Competitors:** Tidio sends real-time notifications. Chatbase has smart escalation. ChatBot has seamless agent alerts.
- **Why critical:** The entire value proposition is "capture leads 24/7." If no one sees the lead for hours, the value is gone.
- **Recommendation:** Email notification when: (a) hot lead captured, (b) handoff requested, (c) new contact with phone/email. Phase 2 can add SMS/push.
- **Effort:** Low-Medium (email via Resend or similar, triggered from existing handoff/lead events)

### HIGH Priority Gaps — Expected within first 30 days of launch

#### 4. Basic Analytics Dashboard
- **Gap:** Data is being collected (UsageRecord, ContactActivity, conversations) but there's no visualization. No conversion funnel, no top questions, no volume trends.
- **Competitors:** Tidio has advanced analytics. Chatbase shows resolution metrics. ChatBot tracks visitor trends.
- **Why it matters:** Customers need to see ROI to justify the subscription. "Your chatbot handled 847 conversations and captured 23 leads this month" is the retention hook.
- **Recommendation:** Single analytics tab showing:
  - Conversation volume (daily/weekly/monthly chart)
  - Lead funnel (new → engaged → qualified → converted)
  - Top 10 questions asked
  - Resolution rate (AI-handled vs handoff)
- **Effort:** Medium (data exists, needs aggregation queries + chart components)

#### 5. Rate Limiting at Scale
- **Gap:** In-memory rate limiter in `lib/rate-limit.ts` doesn't work across Vercel serverless instances. A single abusive user could hit different instances and bypass limits.
- **Competitors:** Not user-facing, but production-critical. Chatbase is SOC 2 certified. Tidio handles 300K+ businesses.
- **Why it matters:** Without this, one bad actor could run up your OpenAI bill. Launch blocker for production.
- **Recommendation:** Migrate to Upstash Redis. Their `@upstash/ratelimit` package is purpose-built for Vercel serverless.
- **Effort:** Low (drop-in replacement, Upstash has a free tier)

#### 6. Playbook Templates (3-5 industry starters)
- **Gap:** Playbook builder is powerful but empty. New users face a blank canvas.
- **Competitors:** Tidio ships 35+ pre-built Flows templates. ChatBot has industry templates.
- **Why it matters:** Service business owners aren't going to design conversation flows from scratch. Templates = instant value.
- **Recommendation:** Ship 3-5 templates:
  - General service inquiry (captures name, phone, service needed)
  - Appointment request (captures preferred time, service, contact)
  - Emergency/urgent service (fast-tracks to handoff)
  - Pricing inquiry (collects scope, provides range or escalates)
  - New customer welcome (introduces business, captures needs)
- **Effort:** Low (JSON playbook definitions, seed script)

### MEDIUM Priority Gaps — Nice for launch, fine for fast-follow

#### 7. Source Citations in Widget Responses
- **Gap:** RAG returns source URLs but unclear if they display to end users in the widget chat.
- **Competitors:** Denser AI's entire brand is built on source citations. Chatbase shows sources.
- **Why it matters:** Citations build trust. When the AI says "Based on your FAQ page..." it feels authoritative, not hallucinated.
- **Recommendation:** Show collapsible source links below AI responses in the widget.
- **Effort:** Low (data exists from RAG, needs UI treatment)

#### 8. Appointment Scheduling MVP
- **Gap:** Not started. PRD says v1 "must support" scheduling or booking intent capture.
- **Competitors:** Tidio, Chatbase (Calendly integration), ChatBot all support some form of booking.
- **Why it matters:** "Book an appointment" is one of the top 3 actions service business visitors want to take.
- **Recommendation:** Don't build a calendar. Instead:
  - Add a playbook "booking intent" action that captures: service, preferred date/time, contact info
  - Store as a booking request in the leads pipeline
  - Notify staff via email (see gap #3)
  - Phase 2: integrate Calendly/Cal.com for real-time booking
- **Effort:** Low (leverages existing playbook engine + lead capture)

#### 9. Knowledge Retraining Pipeline
- **Gap:** Cron job is wired (`api/cron/`) but marked TODO. Doesn't actually re-ingest or update embeddings.
- **Competitors:** Chatbase auto-retrains on Standard+ plans. Denser supports continuous training.
- **Why it matters:** Businesses update their websites. Stale knowledge = wrong answers = lost trust.
- **Recommendation:** Complete the retraining cron to re-scrape websites on a configurable schedule and update embeddings.
- **Effort:** Medium (pipeline exists, needs the actual re-ingestion logic)

### NOT Needed for Phase 1 (defer)

| Feature | Why defer |
|---------|-----------|
| SOC 2 / ISO compliance | Enterprise feature, Phase 6. No SMB buyer asks for this. |
| Multi-LLM model selection | Over-engineering. GPT-4o is fine for launch. |
| Omnichannel (SMS, WhatsApp, Messenger) | Explicitly deferred in PRD. Web widget is enough for v1. |
| Commission-based pricing | Complex billing model. Start with flat subscription. |
| AI-generated landing pages | Cool idea from BigSur, but not core to service businesses. |
| Resolution rate guarantee | Needs months of data before you can make this promise. |
| White-label / remove branding | Phase 2-3 feature for agency channel. |
| Multi-LLM comparison/testing | Enterprise feature. Not needed for SMB launch. |

### Phase 1 Launch Readiness Scorecard

| Requirement | Status | Blocker? |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Tenant can sign up and create a bot | DONE | No |
| Knowledge ingestion (website + PDF + text) | DONE | No |
| AI answers grounded with citations | PARTIAL (citations may not show in widget) | Minor |
| Lead qualification (cold/warm/hot) | DONE | No |
| Handoff packet generated | DONE | No |
| Bilingual EN/ES end-to-end | DONE | No |
| Tenant isolation tested | DONE | No |
| Onboarding guides user through setup | **NOT DONE** | **Yes — activation risk** |
| Plan limits enforced | **NOT DONE** | **Yes — monetization risk** |
| Staff notified on hot leads | **NOT DONE** | **Yes — value delivery risk** |
| Rate limiting works at scale | **NOT DONE** | **Yes — production risk** |
| Basic analytics visible | **NOT DONE** | **No — but retention risk** |

**Bottom line:** Converso has ~80% of what it needs to launch. The 4 blockers above are the difference between "demo-ready" and "revenue-ready."
